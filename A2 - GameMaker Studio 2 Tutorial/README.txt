The purpose of this assignment is to get more comfortable in GameMaker as well as to get you thinking about game design and mechanics.   
Requirements:

Launch GameMaker Studio 2 and in the Explore section, choose "Tutorials".  This will take you to yoyogames Links to an external site..  Scroll through the various choices and choose a Complete Game to do.  Be sure you choose one that is a GML Code type so you are writing code in the game.
Go through the entire tutorial, adding comments throughout your code to demonstrate your understanding.
Submit the entire GameMaker project in a zip file to Canvas.  Zip the entire directory where your GameMaker project is located.
Also submit a README file in your zip where you reflect on the game, the fun factor, changes you would make, etc. 
Extra Credit:

Add a new game mechanic that effects the game play and will, in your opinion, improve the game.  Be creative!  Be sure and document the new mechanic in your README so the graders know what to look for.




README...
In all honesty, this game was exciting to make, and I really enjoyed the fact that I did not have to figure out how to
make any sprites or sounds on my own. However, it took me quite a long time to complete (which could be since I don't have
any background experience with game development and this was quite a long tutorial. Part of the fun factor of this game is
the player's ability to travel anywhere throughout Little Town. There is freedom to pick up any items and run around in the
game world. Also, it is fun for the player to try to figure out which item should be matched to which character. The only
changes I would make would be to add more characters and items and potentially add the ability to enter a different town
once the player completes all the tasks in Little Town.
