The purpose of this assignment is to get more comfortable in GameMaker as well as to get you thinking about game design and mechanics.   
Requirements:

Launch GameMaker Studio 2 and in the Explore section, choose "Tutorials".  This will take you to yoyogames Links to an external site..  Scroll through the various choices and choose a Complete Game to do.  Be sure you choose one that is a GML Code type so you are writing code in the game.
Go through the entire tutorial, adding comments throughout your code to demonstrate your understanding.
Submit the entire GameMaker project in a zip file to Canvas.  Zip the entire directory where your GameMaker project is located.
Also submit a README file in your zip where you reflect on the game, the fun factor, changes you would make, etc. 
Extra Credit:

Add a new game mechanic that effects the game play and will, in your opinion, improve the game.  Be creative!  Be sure and document the new mechanic in your README so the graders know what to look for.
