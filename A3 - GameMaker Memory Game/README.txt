The purpose of this assignment is to complete the GameMaker memory card game we started in class.
Requirements:

Complete the game!
Show all the cards facedown, allow the user to select 2 cards at a time, remove matches as they are found, otherwise flip cards back over if they do not match.  Flipping them back over should happen about a second or so after both cards are shown, to give the player a chance to see them
Keep a timer on the screen that counts down from 60 seconds to 0.
Announce the game as over when all matches are found or time runs out.
Fix any bugs, like clicking the same card twice is counting as a match right now!
Organize your code into scripts:
create_deck should be passed the deck and the size (8), do the work of create obj_cards and putting them into the deck, initialize their type, face, index, and visible properties, then shuffle the deck
shuffle_cards should be passed the deck
all_cards_paired
any other scripts you find useful
