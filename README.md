# Elements-of-Games-and-Game-Development
This repository contains the projects from the Elements of Games and Game Development course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Spring 2023. The README in each contains the project requirements and other necessary information.


Course Description:
This course provides an overview of computer and video game development along with
practical game projects designed to introduce the student to the computer entertainment
industry. Topics will include the nature of games, the game player, game play, game
design, game mechanics, story and character, game worlds, interface and the game
development process. Students will be required to develop code both in C++ and with
the use of two game engines.

Learning Outcomes:
At the completion of the course, you will be able to:
1. Define the process of game software design and development from start to finish.
2. Develop a game design document and project plan to be utilized in the
development and implementation of a game.
3. Develop a working game product using an existing game engine while practicing
Agile principles.
4. Write game programming code and scripting to implement character movement,
collision detection, and simple animation.
5. Identify the core types of AI behavior and their uses, such as pathfinding, fuzzy
logic, cooperative behavior, decision trees, neural nets, adaptive and heuristics.
6. Discuss the importance of story, character, actions and rewards as part of a
successful game design.
7. Implement story, character, gameplay, challenges and mechanics in the design of
a game.
8. Complete small game assignments using both existing game engines and a
game engine developed in class.
