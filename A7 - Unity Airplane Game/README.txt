The purpose of this assignment is to create a Unity airplane game similar to the vehicle world we started in class.
Requirements:

Start with the Assignment7_Starter-Files.unitypackage in the Files->Week10->assets area
There are deliberate bugs in this game that you must fix:
the plane is going backwards
the plane is going way too fast
the plane is tilting automatically
the camera is in front of the plane
the camera is not following the plane
Make the plane go forward and at a slower speed
Make the plane tilt up and down with the arrow keys
Move the camera to be beside the plane and follow along with the plane
Be sure and watch the "Challenge 1 - Outcome" short video in the Instructions folder of your project once you import it, this is what your finished product should look like.
Extra Credit:

Create a script that will spin the plane's propellor
Hint: there is a propellor child object of the plane
