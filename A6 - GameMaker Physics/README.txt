The purpose of this assignment is to write your own physics code in GameMaker Studio 2, do not use the built-in physics engine!

Requirements:

Create or find a star sprite
Add the astronaut, twinkling sun, and at least one planet to your game
Add an astronaut object associated with your sprite
it should rotate with the left/right arrows
it should thrust with the up arrow and create smoke particles
thrust should add acceleration to the astronaut and also play the thruster sound, stopping when the up arrow is released
it should stop with the down arrow
Add lots of stars to your game that need to be collected
when the astronaut collides with a star, that star should be destroyed and disappear, increasing a score
Add a sun and a planet that each gravitationally pull the astronaut towards them
move any common code between them into a script
Add background music and other sounds
