The purpose of this assignment is to complete the GameMaker cherry caves game we started in class.  This assignment will have 2 levels, the first with a static camera and the second with a scrolling camera.
 

Overall requirements:

Give the game a splash screen that leads to the first level
 

Requirements for Level 1:

Make sure Berry can walk, jump, collide with blocks, and climb ladders
Add purple ball enemies that take a Berry life when they hit him, restarting him back at a start position while he has lives remaining.  Purple ball should just bounce up and down, colliding with blocks and changing direction.
Add cherries that earn points
Once all the cherries are gathered, launch Level 2
If all lives are lost, announce "Game Over" on the screen
Have a small GUI at the top that keeps track of score, cherries, and lives
Add at least two sounds
Extra Credit:

Add at least one green ball enemy on a set path that is destroyed once it leaves the room, but takes a Berry life if it hits him
Once all the cherries are gathered, make a Star Goal visible that must be collected to launch Level 2
Hint: put the star in the level to start but make it invisible, revealing it only when all the cherries have been collected
 

Requirements for Level 2:

The camera should scroll left to right, following Berry
Add blocks and ladders and at least one falling or trampoline platform
Add at least one left-to-right moving platform
Put it between blocks so it can collide with them, moving back and forth
Player should move horizontally with the platform while on it
Add at least two sounds to the game
Add at least one green octopus enemy that moves side to side
it can destroy Berry on collision and can be destroyed if jumped on
Add at least one purple octopus enemy that moves up and down, flipping direction (hanging from the top, falling down and sticking to the ground)
it can destroy Berry on collision, and can be destroyed if jumped on
Hint: use an alarm to have it "stick" upside down on a block ceiling, then drop and stick to the floor
Add destroy effects to enemies and Berry
Berry should lose a life if he falls off the world
