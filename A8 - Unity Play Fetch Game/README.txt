The purpose of this assignment is to create a Unity dog fetch game similar to the animal food fight we worked on in class.
Requirements:

Start with the Assignment8_Start.unitypackage in the Files->Week11->assets area
There are deliberate bugs in this game that you must fix:
dogs flying at the top of screen
balls should drop towards the ground
spacebar is spawning balls
spacebar should spawn dogs 
balls are being destroyed when anywhere near a dog
balls should only be destroyed when coming into direct contact with a dog
nothing is being destroyed when going off screen
dogs and balls should be destroyed when they go off screen (the left side or the bottom)
only one type of ball is spawned
ball 1, 2, and 3 should be spawned randomly
Be sure and watch the "Challenge 2 - Outcome" short video in the Instructions folder of your project once you import it, this is what your finished product should look like.
Extra Credit:

Make the spawn interval a random value
Don't allow the player to pound the spacebar key, only allow a new dog to spawn after a certain amount of time
